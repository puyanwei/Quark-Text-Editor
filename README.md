## Quality Control

We challenged ourselves to maintain a high quality standard of coding practices, as well as Agile methodologies during this project.
- All feature and unit tests passing, good coverage.
- Consistent variable naming and linting.
- Small commits and good descriptions.
- Never working off master branch, always using pull requests.
- Good planning and organisation throughout, using our [Trello](https://trello.com/b/mFZ3IP8U/build-our-own-program-from-scratch) board.
- Stand ups in the mornings, retrospectives in the evenings, XP values.
